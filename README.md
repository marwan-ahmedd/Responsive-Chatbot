# Chatbot

Project Description:
This is a basic chatbot that generates responses by learning the percentage of words in a given message and then generating the closest response to the responses stored in the database. The project utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze the input message, identify the key terms, and generate a relevant response.

The system is built using Python and mySQL The project has a simple user interface that allows users to input their message, and the system generates a response based on the input message.

The system's learning algorithm works by breaking down the input message into individual words, calculating the percentage of occurrence for each word, and then comparing this percentage to the percentage of occurrence for each word in the database. The system selects the response with the closest matching percentage of words, and then presents it to the user.

The project is designed to be flexible and easily customizable, allowing users to easily add new responses to the database or modify existing ones. The code is well-documented, and the system is easy to set up and run, even for those with little programming experience.
